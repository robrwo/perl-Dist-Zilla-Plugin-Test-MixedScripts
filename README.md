# NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::MixedScripts - author tests to ensure there is no mixed Unicode

# SYNOPSIS

In the `dist.ini` add:

```
[Test::MixedScripts]
; authordep Test::MixedScripts
script = Latin
script = Common
```

# DESCRIPTION

This generates an author [Test::MixedScripts](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test%3A%3AMixedScripts).

This is an extension of [Dist::Zilla::Plugin::InlineFiles](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist%3A%3AZilla%3A%3APlugin%3A%3AInlineFiles), providing the file `xt/author/mixed-unicode-scripts.t` for
testing against mixed Unicode scripts that are potentially confusing or malicious.

For example, the text for the domain names `оnе.example.com` and `one.example.com` look indistinguishable in many fonts,
but the first one has Cyrillic letters.  If your software interacted with a service on the second domain, then someone
can operate a service on the first domain and attempt to fool developers into using their domain instead.

This might be through a malicious patch submission, or even text from an email or web page that they have convinced a
developer to copy and paste into their code.
